# linguistic_regression_analysis_scarfs
Predicting successful communication outcomes based on linguistic properties of expressions and relationships between communicators using chi-square tests and linear regression models with fixed effects, random intercepts, and interaction terms

In this project, an analysis of the interactions of certain linguistic properties of the target words and relationships between communicators in a game similar to taboo is presented. Results from the original publication of the SCARFS dataset are recreated as well (Trott et al., 2023). The R Markdown file with the complete analysis can be found at: [regression_analysis_linguistic_data_scarfs.qmd](https://github.com/oishani-b/linguistic_regression_analysis_scarfs/blob/7360c559748635d6f2c0b65d41e33bda42f01bb9/regression_analysis_linguistic_data_scarfs.qmd), and the complete report with detailed analyses, background, and limitations can be found at: [Analyses_of_Predicted_Successful_Communication_Based_on_Target_Words_and_Relationship_Types.pdf

Interesting findings from analysis beyond the original publication along with corresponding visualizations are briefly outlined below.
